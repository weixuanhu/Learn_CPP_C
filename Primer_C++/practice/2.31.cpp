    a pointer to a const says, "please guarantee that the value of j does not change via q". 
    Note that the via q is important because the pointer to const declaration doesn't mean that the value pointed to must be a constant, 
    only that whoever is using the pointer can't use the pointer to change the value. */

    /* "please guarantee that the value of i doesn't change", 
    but in the second line the compiler can no longer make that guarantee - the type information on the pointer p is not strict enough
     to tell the compiler not to allow changes to the pointed-to value i.   */
